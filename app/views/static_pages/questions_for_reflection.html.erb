<h1>Qestions for Reflection</h1>

<p><i>The following are some questions that may be helpful in clarifying
what wants to be addressed through a therapeutic process.
Good News/Bad News: It is helpful to keep in mind
that you can make changes in yourself,
not in someone else nor, many times,
in the circumstances that are triggering the distress.
The following questions may be helpful in identifying
the next steps that you can take.</i></p>

<p>What are the physical and emotional sensations that are signaling "pay attention here" (often, these signals are quite uncomfortable)?</p>

<p>What is the change that wants to emerge?</p>

<p>What patterns of thought or self-beliefs support this change?</p>

<p>What is the body position that supports this change (what would sitting/standing/walking look/feel like)?</p>

<p>How would things look/feel/sound/be different if this change was happening now?</p>

<p>What is the next obvious step to creating and cultivating this change?</p>
