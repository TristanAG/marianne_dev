    Life can seem overwhelming at times. Feeling stressed,
    disconnected, anxious, angry, or depressed is an emotional
    signal that something needs tending. These signals often
    show up during life transitions, when what used to work
    is no longer effective -- when a new stage is ready to
    emerge in a person or relationship.
