    Life can seem overwhelming at times. Feeling stressed,
    disconnected, anxious, angry, or depressed is an emotional
    signal that something needs tending. These signals often
    show up during life transitions, when what used to work
    is no longer effective -- when a new stage is ready to
    emerge in a person or relationship.

  Psychotherapy is a process of two people consciously collaborating
for the well-being of one.
Here, an atmosphere is established that supports
and facilitates awareness and growth,
where understanding is gained through inquiry and expanded perspective,
where compassion is generated through deeper sense of connection,
and where access to internal strengths, resources, and resilience
can be cultivated and sustained.

  Practical strategies that involve the body, mind and spirit are explored
to balance and integrate all aspects of being human.
Insights into patterns of relating to oneself and others can lead to
deep transformation and fulfillment of potential for health and well-being.
With mindful awareness of how thoughts, emotions
and the physical body work together and influence each other,
the path to making desired changes becomes clear and, ultimately, do-able.
As self-compassion is cultivated by developing a sense of spaciousness
and kindness with oneself, a relationship that promotes healing emerges.
